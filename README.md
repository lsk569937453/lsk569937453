### ðŸ“Œ Pinned Projects

Here are some of my key projects. I'm passionate about reimplementing and improving existing tools with modern technologies like Rust.

1.  **[Spire](https://github.com/lsk569937453/spire)** - An API Gateway built from the ground up, focusing on performance and extensibility.
2.  **[Git-Statistic](https://github.com/lsk569937453/git-statistic)** - A Git statistics tool developed with Tauri, providing visual insights into your repository's history.
3.  **[Code-Magic](https://github.com/lsk569937453/code-magic-public)** - A collection of local development tools built with Tauri to enhance productivity.
4.  **[RCache](https://github.com/lsk569937453/rcache)** - A reimplementation of Redis in Rust, aiming for high performance and reliability.
5.  **[RCurl](https://github.com/lsk569937453/rcurl)** - A modern, user-friendly reimplementation of the classic cURL command-line tool in Rust.
6.  **[Load-Testing](https://github.com/lsk569937453/loadTesting)** - A lightweight and efficient load testing tool written in Rust, designed for easy and powerful performance testing.

### ðŸš€ 2025 Goals & Focus

In 2025, I am focusing on:

- **Deepening my expertise in Rust** by contributing to open-source projects and exploring advanced concepts like asynchronous programming and systems design.
- **Exploring distributed systems** and building more complex, scalable applications with Go and Rust.
- **Enhancing my existing projects** with new features, improved documentation, and broader community engagement.
- **Learning and applying WebAssembly (Wasm)** to bring high-performance Rust code to the browser.
